### TECHNOLOGIES USED

ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Socket.IO. 

### WHAT IS Hexa-Game?

Hexa-game is a turn by turn, strategy game.

The game is hosted live at hexxagame.herokuapp.com. You will need to login with your google account. When you press play, you will be matched with the next player in queue.

#### Goal
To win, you must control more hexagons when the game ends. The game ends when the board is filled with hexagons.

This is what the game looks like at the start:

### HOW DO YOU PLAY?

The game is played turn by turn and the ruby player starts. During your turn, you select one of your hexagons, and it has the option to either clone or jump.

#### Cloning
Cloning (green spots) - This option allows the user to duplicate their hexagon into the selected position.
#### Jumping
Jumping (yellow spots) - This option will not duplicate the hexagon, instead will jump it to selected position.
#### Taking Over Enemy Hexagons
After players perform a clone or jump, they will take over all enemy hexagons surrounding the cloned/jumped spot. This is where most of the strategy lies!
